# C# Memory Management

This is a .NET Core project I created to explain how memory management works in C#. It has code examples as well as comments that explain what is happening.
It won't go too deep in details about how the Stack and the Heap work, neither will it explain too deeply the concepts behind Finalize, Dispose and Garbage Collection. If you want to learn more details about those, I recommend the article series in the Reference section.
